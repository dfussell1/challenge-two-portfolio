                <p>My name is Dalton Fussell. I am currently learning to become a full-stack developer at a Coding Bootcamp hosted by Vanderbilt University. I have an Associate's in Science from Austin Peay State University where I studied Business Management, but quickly decided that was not the path for me. I then did electrician's work for about a year and a half as well as joining an apprenticeship for it as well, where I completed one year. That leads to where I am now, learning web development with a goal to reach into game development. </p>
